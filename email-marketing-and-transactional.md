# Email Marketing and Transactional Emails

### [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/)
The free plan includes 12,000 emails per month.

### [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/)
Your first 10,000 emails are free every month.

### [Mandrill](http://mandrill.com/) (by Mailchimp)
Every Mandrill account comes with 2,000 free trial sends. Once you’ve finished your free trial, it’s $9.95/month for 25,000 emails. After that, we charge on a per-thousand-email basis. Since we build discounts into our payment structure, your per-email pricing automatically decreases as you send more email.
